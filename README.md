# Welcome to my *Data Analyst Portfolio!*

👋 Hi, I’m a new graduate pursuing a career in Data Analytics/Science. I have a certification in Google Data Analytics and have completed numerous SQL, Python, R, and Power BI Projects.

☕ I’m interested in hiking, travelling, and reading.

🌱 I’m currently learning R and ML, and would like to continue this growth while I start my Master's Degree in the fall.

✍️ This is to showcase my abilities as an aspiring data analyst/scientist. I am attempting to highlight my skills using SQL, Python, and R amongst other languages that I find useful along the way. The projects that I chose to display in the main section of my portfolio were completed using *VS Code*, *Jupyter Notebooks*, and *Power BI*, with some visualizations done on *Tableau* for practice. At the moment I am loving the ease of use that *Jupyter Notebooks* provides.
