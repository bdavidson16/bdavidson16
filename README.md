# Welcome!

👋 Hi, I’m a new graduate pursuing a career in Data Analytics/Science. I have a certification in Google Data Analytics and have completed numerous SQL, Python, and Power BI Projects.

🌱 I’m currently learning R and ML for analysis, and diving deeper in APIs and MongoDB expanding on client/server development.

☕ My hobbies involve hiking, traveling, and reading.

✍️ This portfolio is here to highlight my abilities as an aspiring data analyst. I am attempting to emphasize my skills using SQL, Python, and R amongst other languages that I find useful along the way (such at HTML/CSS for my [*jupyter dashboard*](https://github.com/bdavidson16/Python/tree/main/CDC%3A%20COVID-19%20Dashboard) project). The projects that I chose to display were completed using *VS Code*, *Jupyter Lab*, and *Power BI*.
