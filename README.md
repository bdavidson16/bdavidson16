# Welcome!

👋 Hi, I’m a new graduate pursuing a career in Data Analytics/Science. I have a certification in Google Data Analytics and have completed numerous SQL, Python, and Power BI Projects.

🌱 I’m currently learning R and ML for analysis, and diving deeper in APIs and MongoDB expanding on client/server development.

☕ My hobbies involve hiking, travelling, and reading.

✍️ This is to showcase my abilities as an aspiring data analyst/scientist. I am attempting to highlight my skills using SQL, Python, and R amongst other languages that I find useful along the way. The projects that I chose to display in the main section of my portfolio were completed using *VS Code*, *Jupyter Notebooks*, and *Power BI*, with some visualizations done on *Tableau* for practice. At the moment I am loving the ease of use that *Jupyter Notebooks* provides.
