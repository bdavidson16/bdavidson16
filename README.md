# Welcome!

üëã Hi, I‚Äôm a almost a new graduate pursuing a career in Data Analytics/Science. I have a certification in Google Data Analytics and IBM Data Engineering, as well as a handful of completed SQL, Python, R, and Power BI Projects. Those of which highlight my skill sets that range from data analytics, data engineering, data science, and anywhere in between, will be available to view in this portfolio.

üå± I‚Äôm currently advancing in R and starting to touch on ML for analysis. In addition to those, I am diving deeper in APIs and ETLs to expand on data engineering and client/server development.

‚òï My hobbies involve traveling to new state and national parks, camping, hiking, and reading mystery/fantasy novels (particularly by the campfire).

‚úçÔ∏è This portfolio is here to highlight my abilities as an aspiring data scientist/engineer. I am attempting to emphasize my skills using SQL, Python, and R amongst other languages that I find useful along the way (such at HTML/CSS for my [*jupyter dashboard*](https://github.com/bdavidson16/Python/tree/main/CDC%3A%20COVID-19%20Dashboard) project). The projects that I chose to display were completed using *VS Code*, *Jupyter Lab*, and *Power BI*.
