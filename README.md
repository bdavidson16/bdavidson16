---># Welcome to my ***Data Engineer Portfolio***!

This is to showcase my abilities as a data scientist. I am attempting to highlight my skills using Python, SQL and R amongst other languages that I find useful along the way. I will also keep my school projects, papers, and any other assignments available, especially highlighting those that I feel are relevant to my career and are valuable to any computer scientist.

The projects that I choose to display in the main section of my portfolio were completed using *BigQuery*, *Jupyter Notebooks*, and *Tableau*, with some visualizations done on *Power BI* for practice. At the moment I am loving the ease of use that *Jupyter Notebooks* provides. I am able to use *[SQL]* ,*[Python]*, and *[R]* all in one. Then nicely display my work in more presentable way so I can commit it to GitHub in a timely manner.

## SQL
As for my *SQL* projects, I have chosen quite a few datasets from a wide-variety of fields so I can get more practice by running into different problems. A good percentage of them are from the healthcare industry because my background in health administration not only makes more feel more at home when doing these projects but I can also take these projects a few steps further from my fellow peers who lack the background experience that I have. I am also currently working through popular projects like the *8 Week SQL Challenge* and the *Uber Trip Analysis* to get more practice and to be able to double-check my work.

## Visualization

  - *Power BI* (*Intermediate*)
  - *Tableau* (*Beginner*)

## Certifications

  - **[Google Data Analytics Certificate](https://coursera.org/share/cca622b30550567720b3a148c4231f77)**

## Education
Within this portfolio are some assignments from my schoolwork that I felt are nice to have on hand for future reference and to show you my continuous development as a computer/data scientist. They mainly focus on [Java], [C++], and MATLAB, and have taught me about program testing, security, proper coding practices, etc. These skills have shaped the way I look at and think about problems, whether it be for computer science or in everyday life.
